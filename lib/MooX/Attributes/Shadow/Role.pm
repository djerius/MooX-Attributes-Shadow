  # in the contained class
  package Foo;
  use Moo;
  with 'MooX::Attributes::Shadow::Role';

  shadowable_attrs 'x', 'y';

  has x => ( is => 'ro' );
  has y => ( is => 'ro' );


  # in the container class

  package Bar;

  use Moo;
  use Foo;

  # create accessors with a prefix to avoid collisions; no need to
  # specify which ones
  Foo->shadow_attrs( fmt => sub { 'pfx_' . shift } );

  # create an attribute which holds the contained oject, and
  # delegate the shadowed accessors to it.
  has foo   => ( is => 'ro',
                 lazy => 1,
                 default => sub { Foo->new_from_attrs( shift ) },
                 handles => Foo->shadowed_attrs,
               );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<MooX::Attributes::Shadow::Role> provides a means for a class to
identify attributes which should be shadowed to classes which contain
it.  (See B<MooX::Attributes::Shadow> for more on what this means).
A class containing a class composed with this role need know nothing about
the attributes which will be shadowed, and can use the class methods to
integrate the shadowable attributes into their interface.


=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Contained class functions

=over

=item B<shadowable_attrs>

  shadowable_attrs @attrs;

This is called by the contained class to identify which attributes are
available for shadowing.  It does B<not> create them, it merely
records them.

Subsequent calls will return the names of the attributes which may be
shadowed as an array:

   Class->shadowable_attrs( qw[ a b c ] );
   @attrs = Class->shadowable_attrs;

=head2 Class methods for use by the Container Classes

=over

=item B<shadow_attrs>

   ContainedClass->shadow_attrs( %options );

This method creates read-only attributes shadowing the
I<ContainedClass>'s shadowable attributes in the class which calls it.

It takes the following options:

=over

=item fmt

This is a reference to a subroutine which should return a modified
attribute name (e.g. to prevent attribute collisions).  It is passed
the attribute name as its first parameter.

=item instance

In the case where more than one instance of an object is contained,
this (string) is used to identify an individual instance.

=item private

If true, the actual attribute name is mangled; the attribute
initialization name is left untouched (see the C<init_arg> option to
the B<Moo> C<has> subroutine).  This defaults to true.

=back

=item B<shadowed_attrs>

  $attrs = ContainedClass->( [$container,] \%options );

Return a hash of attributes shadowed into C<$container>.  If
C<$container> is provided it may be either a class name or an
object. If it is not provided, the package name of the calling routine
is used.

It takes the following options:

=over

=item instance

In the case where more than one instance of an object is contained,
this (string) is used to identify an individual instance.

=back

The keys in the returned hash are the attribute initialization names
(not the mangled ones) in the I<container> class; the hash values are
the attribute names in the I<contained> class.  This makes it easy to
delegate accessors to the contained class:

  has foo   => ( is => 'ro',
                 lazy => 1,
                 default => sub { Foo->new( Foo->xtract_attrs( shift ) ) },
                 handles => Foo->shadowed_attrs,
               );

=item B<xtract_attrs>

  %attrs = ContainedClass->xtract_attrs( $container_obj, \%options );

After the container class is instantiated, B<xtract_attrs> is used to
extract attributes for the contained object from the container object.

It takes the following options:

=over

=item instance

In the case where more than one instance of an object is contained,
this (string) is used to identify an individual instance.

=back

=item B<new_from_attrs>

  $obj = ContainedClass->new_from_attrs( $container_obj );
  $obj = ContainedClass->new_from_attrs( $container_obj, %attr );
  $obj = ContainedClass->new_from_attrs( $container_obj, \%options );
  $obj = ContainedClass->new_from_attrs( $container_obj, \%options, \%attr );
  $obj = ContainedClass->new_from_attrs( $container_obj, \%options,  %attr );

Create a new contained object from the attributes shadowed in the
container object.  Additional attributes and values may be passed.

It takes the following options:

=over

=item instance

In the case where more than one instance of an object is contained,
this (string) is used to identify an individual instance.
